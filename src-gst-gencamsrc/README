Generic Plugin Element Properties:

The following are the list of properties supported by the `gencamsrc` gstreamer element.

  acquisition-mode    : Sets the acquisition mode of the device. It defines mainly the number of frames to capture during an acquisition and the way the acquisition stops. Possible values (continuous/multiframe/singleframe)
  balance-ratio       : Controls ratio of the selected color component to a reference color component
  balance-ratio-selector: Selects which Balance ratio to control. Possible values(All,Red,Green,Blue,Y,U,V,Tap1,Tap2...)
  balance-white-auto  : Controls the mode for automatic white balancing between the color channels. The white balancing ratios are automatically adjusted. Possible values(Off,Once,Continuous)
  binning-horizontal  : Number of horizontal photo-sensitive cells to combine together. This reduces the horizontal resolution (width) of the image. A value of 1 indicates that no horizontal binning is performed by the camera.
  binning-horizontal-mode: Sets the mode to use to combine horizontal photo-sensitive cells together when BinningHorizontal is used. Possible values (sum/average)
  binning-selector    : Selects which binning engine is controlled by the BinningHorizontal and BinningVertical features. Possible values (sensor/region0/region1/region2)
  binning-vertical    : Number of vertical photo-sensitive cells to combine together. This reduces the vertical resolution (height) of the image. A value of 1 indicates that no vertical binning is performed by the camera.
  binning-vertical-mode: Sets the mode to use to combine vertical photo-sensitive cells together when BinningHorizontal is used. Possible values (sum/average)
  black-level         : Controls the analog black level as an absolute physical value.
  black-level-auto    : Controls the mode for automatic black level adjustment. The exact algorithm used to implement this adjustment is device-specific. Possible values(Off/Once/Continuous)
  black-level-selector: Selects which Black Level is controlled by the various Black Level features. Possible values(All,Red,Green,Blue,Y,U,V,Tap1,Tap2...)
  blocksize           : Size in bytes to read per buffer (-1 = default)
  decimation-horizontal: Horizontal sub-sampling of the image.
  decimation-vertical : Number of vertical photo-sensitive cells to combine together.
  device-clock-selector: Selects the clock frequency to access from the device. Possible values (Sensor/SensorDigitization/CameraLink/Device-specific)
  do-timestamp        : Apply current stream time to buffers
  exposure-auto       : Sets the automatic exposure mode when ExposureMode is Timed. Possible values(off/once/continuous)

  exposure-time       : Sets the Exposure time (in us) when ExposureMode is Timed and ExposureAuto is Off. This controls the duration where the photosensitive cells are exposed to light.
  exposure-time-selector: Selects which exposure time is controlled by the ExposureTime feature. This allows for independent control over the exposure components. Possible values(common/red/green/stage1/...)
  frame-rate          : Controls the acquisition rate (in Hertz) at which the frames are captured.
  gain                : Controls the selected gain as an absolute value. This is an amplification factor applied to video signal. Values are device specific.
  gain-auto           : Sets the automatic gain control (AGC) mode. Possible values (off/once/continuous)
  gain-auto-balance   : Sets the mode for automatic gain balancing between the sensor color channels or taps. Possible values (off/once/continuous)
  gain-selector       : Selects which gain is controlled by the various Gain features. It's device specific. Possible values (All/Red/Green/Blue/Y/U/V...)
  gamma               : Controls the gamma correction of pixel intensity.
  gamma-selector      : Select the gamma correction mode. Possible values (sRGB/User)
  height              : Height of the image provided by the device (in pixels).
  hw-trigger-timeout  : Wait timeout (in multiples of 5 secs) to receive frames before terminating the application.
  name                : The name of the object
  num-buffers         : Number of buffers to output before sending EOS (-1 = unlimited)
  offset-x            : Horizontal offset from the origin to the region of interest (in pixels).
  offset-y            : Vertical offset from the origin to the region of interest (in pixels).
  packet-delay        : Controls the delay (in GEV timestamp counter unit) to insert between each packet for this stream channel. This can be used as a crude flow-control mechanism if the application or the network infrastructure cannot keep up with the packets coming from the device.
  packet-size         : Specifies the stream packet size, in bytes, to send on the selected channel for a Transmitter or specifies the maximum packet size supported by a receiver.
  parent              : The parent of the object
                        Object of type "GstObject"
  pixel-format        : Format of the pixels provided by the device. It represents all the information provided by PixelSize, PixelColorFilter combined in a single feature. Possible values (mono8/ycbcr411_8/ycbcr422_8/rgb8/bgr8/bayerbggr/bayerrggb/bayergrbg/bayergbrg)
  reset               : Resets the device to its power up state. After reset, the device must be rediscovered. Do not use unless absolutely required.
  serial              : Device's serial number. This string is a unique identifier of the device.
  throughput-limit    : Limits the maximum bandwidth (in Bps) of the data that will be streamed out by the device on the selected Link. If necessary, delays will be uniformly inserted between transport layer packets in order to control the peak bandwidth.
  trigger-activation  : Specifies the activation mode of the trigger. Possible values (RisingEdge/FallingEdge/AnyEdge/LevelHigh/LevelLow)
  trigger-delay       : Specifies the delay in microseconds (us) to apply after the trigger reception before activating it.
  trigger-divider     : Specifies a division factor for the incoming trigger pulses
  trigger-multiplier  : Specifies a multiplication factor for the incoming trigger pulses.
  trigger-overlap     : Specifies the type trigger overlap permitted with the previous frame or line. Possible values (Off/ReadOut/PreviousFrame/PreviousLine)
  trigger-selector    : Selects the type of trigger to configure. Possible values (AcquisitionStart/AcquisitionEnd/AcquisitionActive/FrameStart/FrameEnd/FrameActive/FrameBurstStart/FrameBurstEnd/FrameBurstActive/LineStart/ExposureStart/ExposureEnd/ExposureActive/MultiSlopeExposureLimit1)
  trigger-source      : Specifies the internal signal or physical input Line to use as the trigger source. Possible values (Software/SoftwareSignal<n>/Line<n>/UserOutput<n>/Counter<n>Start/Counter<n>End/Timer<n>Start/Timer<n>End/Encoder<n>/<LogicBlock<n>>/Action<n>/LinkTrigger<n>/CC<n>/...)
  typefind            : Run typefind before negotiating (deprecated, non-functional)
  width               : Width of the image provided by the device (in pixels).

**Note:**

* `serial` property is not mandatory to use if only a single camera is connected to the system. In case multiple cameras are connected to the system and the `serial` property is not used then the plugin will connect to the camera which is connected first in the device index list.

* If `width` and `height` properties are not specified then the plugin will set to the maximum resolution supported by the camera.

* `hw-trigger-timeout` is the time for which the plugin waits for the H/W trigger. The reason this time-out value is in multiple of 5 sec is because the maximum grab timeout for each frame is 5 secs. Hence even if `hw-trigger-timeout=1` is set, the plugin will wait for 5 secs.

* In case frame capture is failing when multiple basler cameras are used, use the `packet-delay` property to increase the delay between the transmission of each packet for the selected stream channel. Depending on the number of cameras appropriate delay can be set. Increasing the `packet-delay` will decrease the frame rate.
